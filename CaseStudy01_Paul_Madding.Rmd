## Introduction

*With a strong presence across the 50 states and the District of Columbia, craft breweries are a vibrant and flourishing economic force at the local, state and national level. As consumers continue to demand a wide range of high quality, full-flavored beers, small and independent craft brewers are meeting this growing demand with innovative offerings, creating high levels of economic value in the process.*

This project will focus on gaining incite into breweries in the United Stated. We will focus on providing information to a national brewery for them to look into investing in the craft brewery industry.

## Data

The data for this study will consist of two databases collected and supplied by our client.

**Data/Beers.csv**

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Name | name of beer |
| BeerID | unique id number of the beer |
| ABV | alcohol by volume of beer |
| IBU | international bitterness units of the beer |
| Style | style of beer |
| Ounces | unit of measurement for the beer by oz |

**Data/Breweries.csv**

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Name | name of beer |
| Brew_ID | unique identification number of the brewery |
| Name | name of brewery |
| City | city where brewery is located |
| State | state where brewery is located |

## Questions our client would like addresses

Load libraries
```{r library, echo=FALSE}
#load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


Read the two databases into R
```{r read data, echo=TRUE}
#read in the two databases
breweries <- read.csv("Data/Breweries.csv")
beers <- read.csv("Data/Beers.csv")
```


   1. How many breweries are present in each state?
```{r breweries state}
#count breweries in each state
brew_state <- table(breweries$State)
brew_state
```

   2. Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.
```{r merge data}
#looking at each database to see problems before the merge
head(beers)
head(breweries)
#rename Brew_ID to Brewery_id to merge data
colnames(breweries)[1] <- "Brewery_id"
#both have a "Name" two for different groups
#rename Name to Brewery_Name
colnames(breweries)[2] <- "Brewery_Name"
#rename Name to Beer_Name
colnames(beers)[1] <- "Beer_Name"
#merge both data sets
brew_beer <- merge.data.frame(beers, breweries, by = "Brewery_id")
#print the first 6 observations
head(brew_beer, 6)
#print the last 6 observations
tail(brew_beer, 6)
```

   3. Report the number of NA's in each column.
```{r count NAs}
#use colSum to sum up the NA's in each column
colSums(is.na(brew_beer))

```

   4. Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.
```{r}
#Compute the median alcohol content (ABV) by state
medABV <- tapply(brew_beer$ABV, brew_beer$State, function(x) median = median(x, na.rm = TRUE))
#Compute the median international bitterness unit (IBU) by state
medIBU <- tapply(brew_beer$IBU, brew_beer$State, function(x) median = median(x, na.rm = TRUE))
#sort ABV in desending order

#plot a bar chart to compare ABV and IBU
#convert AVB and IBU to a data frame
medABVbar <- data.frame(medABV)
medIBUbar <- data.frame(medIBU)

#add a State column to ABV and IBU
medABVbar$State <- rownames(medABVbar)
medIBUbar$State <- rownames(medIBUbar)

#plot a bar chart for ABV
ggplot(medABVbar, aes(x=State, y=medABV)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="gray", fill="blue") +
  xlab("Alcohol Content by State") + ylab("State") +
  ggtitle("Median ABV by State") +
  coord_flip() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5), text = element_text(size=7.5))

#Remove SD from the list due to no IBU data
medIBUbar <- medIBUbar[-grep("SD", medIBUbar$State),]
#plot a bar chart for IBU
ggplot(medIBUbar, aes(x=State, y=medIBU)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="gray", fill="blue") +
  xlab("IBU by State") + ylab("State") +
  ggtitle("Median IBU by State") +
  coord_flip() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5), text = element_text(size=7.5))

```

   5. Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
   
   6. Summary statistics for the ABV variable.
   
   7. Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.
